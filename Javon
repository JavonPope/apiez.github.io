         I am currently a sophmore at Towers High School in Belvedere Park, Georgia. Previously, I attended Centennial Academy all 8 years K-8
         As of right now I want to go to Midtown Highschool for my junior and senior year. I am from Atlanta, Georgia. 16. I won Most improved 
         Math and Ela back in middle school. I played Soccer, Basketball, and football. In the future I would like to be a Youtuber/Streamer or
         do somthing related to technology. I am good to those I care about. I am happy and grateful. I have a little brother that is 5, A sister
         that is 16, and a brother that is starting his music career. I always either compelete my work on time before hand or do it late and 
         rush to finish it. I like watching movies and tv shows. My favorite time of year is basically Nov 1 to December 31 beacuse of christmas and thanksgiving.
